    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>The creators of The Saints Roleplay and The Saints: 1998 are proud to present <strong>The Saints Roleplay 2.0</strong>, a completely overhauled, fresh, and immersive roleplaying experience! Dive into our <strong>QB-Core framework</strong> server, designed to offer a lore-friendly environment inspired by the vibrant and dynamic <strong>Greater Los Angeles</strong> area. Whether you're a seasoned roleplayer or just starting, <strong>this is the city where your story begins</strong>.</p>
    <h2>How do you operate?</h2>
    <p>We are live <strong>24/7</strong>, so the city never sleeps! Whether you're a night owl or an early riser, <strong>there’s always action waiting for you</strong>.</p>
    <p>Our server thrives on two core principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Social Connections</strong>: Meet, interact, and develop your character with other players who share your passion for roleplay.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Economy</strong>: Make your mark in the city by earning your way through a balanced and thriving economy—<strong>start a business, hustle in the streets, or climb the corporate ladder</strong>. Your story, your way.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What does lore-friendly mean?</h2>
    <p>When we say “lore-friendly,” we mean it. <strong>The Saints Roleplay 2.0</strong> operates within the familiar and immersive world of <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong>. All assets, from vehicles to weapons, follow the branding and lore of the GTA universe, ensuring a seamless and immersive experience.</p>
